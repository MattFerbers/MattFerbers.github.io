> The Sun gives its light to the Moon without asking for anything in return.

I've stumbled across this quote, which I am heavily paraphrasing and butchering since I didn't write it down, some days ago and I've been thinking on and off ever since.

Of course, my reaction to reading this was to immediately project myself in this situation, because I am oh so ever important. But yes, this little quote, or a more poetic variation of it has been living in my head for a few days. 

Even more of course I had to identify with the Moon, since taking a leading role in any relationship is impossible for me. Doing things, being proactive, holding a conversation are all active roles that no matter how interested I am in the other person I simply am not able to do. This feels awful because often times people enjoy some interaction when talking, and rightfully so, but after a topic is spent and the conversation starts to cool down I am unable to start anything new. Asking some friends to go on a hike, on a specific group we made *just* for that? Let me look over the draft of this message for a few hours, just to discard it after much consideration. Some people are organizing an event? Well I haven't been explicitly asked to participate, they clearly do not want me.

To do anything I need someone to directly tell me what to do and how to do it in minute details. I need a Sun shining its light on me, encouraging me, guiding me. This is a completely egoistic point of view, that benefits me and me alone since I all I can give is a dimmer, colder version of what I received, just like moonlight.

I have seen different people in my life taking on the role of the Sun for a bit. Being around someone like that leads to an unsettling mix of feelings: on one hand I am really ecstatic, because I finally have someone to hang out with, someone I can talk to. On the other hand I am aware of what I am doing, of the type of relationship I am creating. Sometimes people are ok with being such selfless givers, but in reality they're really not. And it makes perfect sense. Who would want to have to deal to such an extend with someone that needs to be taught how to talk, how to feel, how to behave like a normal human? No one. Even if I recently found some amazing people that manage to tolerate me, I can see that they're loosing interest quickly. This is not me accusing them of anything, just a realization that I'm having. 

Maybe this whole entry is based on a wrong preconception: the Sun and the Moon example is way too idyllic, too poetic for what I'm actually describing. I am not the Moon, and they're not the Sun. I am a leech and they are an arm I can attach to. I will however stick with the other metaphor, as I am quite poetic and sophisticated.

So this is what I've been thinking about lately. It is still a pretty sterile thought: nothing was gained from this, if not the feeling of being a self centered asshole. I'm forcing myself to believe that this will eventually develop in me improving myself, but in all honesty I have some trouble actually believing it.
