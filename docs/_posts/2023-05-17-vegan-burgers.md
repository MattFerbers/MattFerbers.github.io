I am in the kitchen, pulling some vegan burgers patties out of the freezer, I'm listening to music, but the crappy headphones keep disconnecting. I should buy a new pair but I won't. I don't listen to music all that much anyways. A melancholic song is playing, it's singing how a big reward is about to come, but the song will end before that happens, it's quite clever I think. 

But most of all I am upset at myself. I have fallen back to my old habits, I am once again shutting myself in both metaphorically and literally. I've spend the last weekend feeling sad and lonely, so naturally when I saw some friends organizing a night out what did I do? Why did I not go with them?
I can list the reasons why: they're going to eat out and it's going to be expensive, the weather looks like it's about to rain, the place they're staying isn't even that good, I don't know how to get there, and a thousand others. So mine was actually a thought out decision, I once again analyzed what was presented to me and made the optimal choice. These are only excuses, excuses I am telling myself. I'm sure I can afford a single night out after nine months of working. Who cares if it's going to rain, I've walked for hours under the rain before. So what if the food isn't great? It's not going to be worse than the microwaved frozen pizza I'm having. A friend had room in his car, I could have just asked. Why? Why do I have to lie to myself? The truth is that writing "Hey I'm coming too" hurts more than just being sad and alone.

Why is it so hard? I don't know, maybe that's what I'm used to. A second truth is that I cannot stop doubting myself. Because I cannot stop thinking about how much of a burden I am to everyone. Someone has to drive me there. Someone has to keep up the conversation. Someone has to tell me where to go because I don't know the city. Someone has to sit next to me, who will screw up small talk. They must hate me, and they must dread the moment I dare write in the group chat.

This is of course not true. Though flawed, my friends have gone way beyond their friendly duties just to include me in their activities. Many times they have basically forced me to go out with them, because they have realized how I act.
Of course they don't do this all the time, because why would they? No one deserves to work without any compensation. Moreover I act like the "cool" lone wolf loner weirdo, that just does whatever he feels like, without a care for societal norms. How well that turned out for me. So scared to be who I am that I need to write my thoughts on an online journal, in the hope someone would find them.

So I know my friends don't hate me (even if as I am writing that the thoughts in my head started whispering "But what if they did?"), then why do I have to deal with thoughts like these? I don't know. It's hard to get rid of them. Any positive thing that happens has to be marked by their presence. All failures are made then time worse by the knowledge that this is how things were supposed to go all along.

Today I went to the doctor, for some health problems I've been having: my heart is pounding so hard that I can feel it echo in my head, and my hip hurts every time I go hiking, with a sharp pain in the bone. The doctor seemed pretty unimpressed by my problems, but gave me some tests to run anyways. At the end of this I managed to blurt out, completely nonchalantly, just because I'm such a cool lone wolf, if maybe, there was the possibility, if just maybe the national health system offered therapy. I couldn't just say that I wanted to see a therapist. I had to hint at it. But still, I managed that and I am proud of it. The sentence before was probably another product of my thoughts, I couldn't just be proud that I managed to do something hard but I also had to bring myself down because I did not do it according to some standard I set for myself. I could spend a long time writing about the self imposed, meaningless and impossible standards I set for myself, but that is a topic for another time.

So, I did it. I managed to express that I needed to see a therapist. What did it take? It took a lot of convincing from friends. It took me turning down free therapy offered from a fried because I felt bad making him work for free. It took weeks of me practicing in the car what I would say to the doctor. But I did it.

Unfortunately for me this is not the end. I now have a prescription, but it's up to me to book an appointment. How lucky. Another phone call to make, another bunch of doubts I have to deal with. I have somehow to fit this in my schedule, without missing hours at work. 
For some reason it really hurt when the doctor told me I had to contact the *center for mental hygiene*. It sounds so brutal. Do I really need it? Am I unhygienic? Again the doubts cloud my mind. I accomplished something today.

I am having vegan burgers tonight, and I feel accomplished. I feel alive. I will deal with everything else another time.
