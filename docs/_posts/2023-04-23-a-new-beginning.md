Lately I have felt the urge to create something with my hands. To produce something, to see it take shape in my hands until it is, at least somewhat, finished. And this journal for now will be this creation that I've so craved. Maybe it isn't really what I wanted when I was looking to create something but for now it will have to do. In the end I think it does fit my criteria of a hand-made *thing*, so I will try not to be too critical on it. It also allows me to test out my really dusty front-end website development skills, which also adds to the whole producing something feeling.

After this technical introduction I think it is fair to explain why I decided to write this journal, after all if I wanted to code something that badly there are plenty of other projects to try out. 
As someone that commutes for around three hours daily, it would make sense to spend a good portion of that time absorbed in my own thoughts. Truth is that for the last five years I avoided this delicate process completely. I would do anything to avoid being confronted with whatever was inside my head at that moment. So as a good automata I would follow my set routine, doing whatever I needed to do in the city until I could retreat into my isolated suburban life. Since I was a student for those past five years it was easy to always be busy either studying, working on assignment, writing reports and so on. After I had to abandon my academic life I was faced with the terrible realization that after my shift was over I had nothing to do. With nothing to keep my mind busy, and some hefty encouragement from a friend, I had to actually deal with what I was able to ignore for so long.

This journal is both the conclusion and the start of my reflections on my own life: it marks the end of me just wondering in my thoughts without concluding anything, and it signals the start, hopefully, of a way to bind blurry ideas and thoughts into words for me to think about.

The more I am writing the more I realize how much I am trying to justify this whole process. In truth I just need to write down what is going on with me, even if I'll never read it again, because reading this sort of stuff is embarassing, like hearing yourself talk, and the real introspection comes from having to turn thoughts into words anyways. Of course it had to be online because I am just that much self-centered, but also because I secretly hope that someone that knows me "in real life" ends up finding this, connects the dots behind the crappy alias, and reads my confession of who I really am, and what I've been hiding from them.
